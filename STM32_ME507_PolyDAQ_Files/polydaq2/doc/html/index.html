<h1><a class="anchor" id="Introduction"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>PolyDAQ is a customizable, embeddable data acquisition device for educational use. It was originally designed for use in the Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering Thermal Laboratory, but it has been improved with the intention that it will be usable for many different applications. It can function as a data acquisition card for a small computer or a standalone datalogger. All hardware and software is open source.</p>

Sensors</h1>
<p>PolyDAQ's hardware features include thermocouple, voltage, strain, and acceleration inputs. Although traces are present on the board to accommodate all of these features, some features may be left off an individual board to save money and electric power. In addition, several versions of PolyDAQ have the same processor and run the same software but are equipped with different sets of sensors: </p>
<ul>
<li>Four thermocouple inputs, using AD8494 or AD8495 thermocouple signal conditioners for linear amplification and cold junction compensation. </li>
<li>Four voltage inputs. Some voltage inputs use a moderately high input resistance voltage divider and an op-amp voltage follower with level shifter to allow an input range of -10 to +10 volts. This scheme is similar to that used in other low-cost DAQ devices such as the USB-600X series from National Instruments(tm). Other voltage inputs can be set up without voltage dividers to give 0-3.3V full-scale measurements. The A/D converters use a precision 3.3V reference for accuracy. </li>
<li>Up to four strain gauge bridge amplifiers whose INA122 instrumentation amplifiers allow resolution down to the microstrain in typical Wheatstone bridge applications.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Components"></a>
Components</h1>
<p>Basic components common to all PolyDAQ 2's include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>An STM32F4 microcontroller which controls the data acquisition process and communicates with a PC (if used). </li>
<li>A USB-serial interface which can supply power to the board through the USB cable as well as communicate between the PolyDAQ and the computer. Power can also be supplied as 5 - 12 volts DC through a standard barrel jack. </li>
<li>A Bluetooth serial modem for wireless communication with laptops, tablets, or phones (if installed). </li>
<li>A micro-SD card socket. SD cards of up to around 32GB capacity can be used, and data is stored in files using the old DOS low-level format. CSV text files are the standard file format, but other file formats can be utilized with small changes to the firmware. Using SDIO card access rather than the slower SPI protocol, data has been saved at up to 36KB/s in tests so far, and we expect speed improvements as the software is refined. </li>
<li>Programmability (to flash updated firmware) through a 6-pin STLink2 connector.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Firmware"></a>
Firmware</h1>
<p>The PolyDAQ firmware is based on the STM32 Standard Peripheral Library and FreeRTOS. This software was chosen for its compatibility with software used in Cal Poly ME mechatronics courses, which was in turn selected as the preferred RTOS environment for educational use. FreeRTOS isn't known as an especially high performance RTOS, but its internal structure is more easily understood than those of many competing products - multithreading and device access are not as hidden from the application programmer as in many other RTOSes, so students can learn more about many important fundamentals. Performance is not that much of an issue, especially when we have an STM32F4 processor which runs at 168 MHz and has hardware floating point support.</p>
<p>GUI applications are being written for use on major PC operating systems (Linux, Mac<sup>TM</sup>, Windows<sup>TM</sup>) and if we have good luck in porting, Android<sup>TM</sup>. The applications are written in Python and use the Qt GUI libraries, NumPy, and PyQwt.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Version"></a>
Version</h1>
<p>This page documents PolyDAQ Version 2.1. As of this writing (March 2015), PolyDAQ 2 is a work in progress. Prototypes have been made and are undergoing testing, and a production run of a dozen or so boards is being produced. </p>
