<div class="textblock"><p>This page describes how to connect a PolyDAQ to power and communication circuits.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pds_power"></a>
Power</h1>
<p>The PolyDAQ 2 has two power connections; either may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mini-USB connector supplies power and enables communication to a PC. If communication is not needed, a USB charger can be used to power the board for data logging. Note that this is <em>not</em> a micro-USB as is used by many cell phones and e-readers but a slightly larger "Mini B" plug.</li>
<li>A standard "barrel jack" connector allows the PolyDAQ 2 to be supplied from a battery or a "wall wart" type plug-in power supply. Such an external power supply must be rated at 5 volts to 12 volts with at least 250mA of current capacity. Batteries should supply a voltage between 5 volts and 9 volts. A direct connection to an automotive electrical circuit should <b>not</b> be used because most automotive circuits produce voltage spikes that can destroy a PolyDAQ. Use a separate battery or plug-in USB charger for automotive applications.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pds_serial"></a>
Serial Communications</h1>
<p>The mini-USB connector on the PolyDAQ 2 can be used for serial communication between the PolyDAQ and a desktop or laptop computer. When a PolyDAQ is connected via USB to a properly configured PC, a USB serial port connection is automatically made.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Linux</b> computers are configured to communicate with a PolyDAQ out of the box &ndash; no additional drivers are needed. The USB serial port will be named <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> if no other similar USB serial device is connected. If other USB serial devices are connected, the PolyDAQ can be named <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code>, or <code>/dev/ttyUSB2</code>, <em>etc</em>.</li>
<li><b>Windows(tm)</b> computers often need to have drivers installed for the USB serial chip on the PolyDAQ. Windows(tm) often recognizes the USB serial chip when it's plugged into the USB port and automatically installs the correct drivers. When it does not, drivers for the FT232RL chip are available at <code><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com">http://www.ftdichip.com</a></code>. When the drivers are working, the PolyDAQ's serial port will then be named <code>COM3</code> or <code>COM4</code> or <code>COM5</code> or something similar, depending on how many virtual serial port devices have been plugged into the computer before.</li>
<li><b>Mac(tm)</b> computers do something really cool and shiny but we're not sure what because we can't afford one. This section will be updated after we've had a chance to borrow a Mac(tm) from one of the Cool Kids and try it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The USB serial port can be accessed from a desktop or laptop computer using the PolyDAQ 2 GUI (see the <a class="el" href="pd_py_gui.html">PolyDAQ GUI</a> page for details) or through a dumb terminal emulator program. A "dumb terminal" is a program which allows the user to type characters which are immediately sent to the PolyDAQ and to see characters which the PolyDAQ has sent back; the terminal is called "dumb" because it does little or no processing of the characters &ndash; it just sends and receives them unthinkingly. There are many dumb terminal programs available for free:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Linux</b> computers can use PuTTY, GTKterm, Screen, or Minicom.</li>
<li><b>Windows(tm)</b> computers can use PuTTY; some older Windows computers have a program called "Hyperterminal" installed by default.</li>
<li><b>Mac(tm)</b> computers can use PuTTY through MacPorts, but this seems to be a lot of hassle to set up. One can also use the terminal program <code>screen</code> to talk to a serial port; see <code><a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32834/is-there-an-os-x-terminal-program-that-can-access-serial-ports">http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32834/is-there-an-os-x-terminal-program-that-can-access-serial-ports</a></code> for more details. Terminal emulators must be set to the correct communication mode and rate in order to successfully communicate with the PolyDAQ. The following settings must be used: <table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th align="left"></th><th align="center"></th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Baud rate </td><td align="center">115200 </td></tr>
<tr>

</table>
The PolyDAQ 2 has a simple terminal interface which allows the user to see status and data through the dumb terminal. Most commands are single letters. Tables of the commands that return measurement data are given on the <a class="el" href="pd_channels.html">Channel Commands</a> page. Example commands are:</li>
<li><b>0</b> through <b>9</b> - Display the results of A/D conversions from the A/D converter's cannels 0 through 9. Many of these channels aren't connected to anything, so the results won't have meaning.</li>
<li><b>A</b> through <b>F</b> - These are interpreted by the PolyDAQ as hexadecimal numbers from 10 (A) through 15 (F), and the PolyDAQ returns the results of A/D conversions from those channels.</li>
<li><b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>Z</b> - The PolyDAQ returns a raw reading from one of the built-in accelerometer's axes (if an accelerometer is on the board).</li>
<li><b>O</b> (uppercase letter O) - Turn on oversampling. If on, all readings from all channels will be taken the given number of times and the average value returned. The <b>O</b> must be followed by a number between 0 and 250, then a carriage return. Typed characters may not be echoed, so type carefully.</li>
<li><b>h</b> or <b></b>? - Show a help screen listing commands that can be used.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pds_sd_card"></a>
The Micro-SD Card for Data Logging</h1>
<p>The PolyDAQ 2 can log data to a Micro-SD card continuously at up to about 500 samples per second. Data is saved to comma-separated-variable (CSV) files which can be read easily by spreadsheet programs such as OpenOffice Calc and MS-Excel(tm) or imported into mathematical programs such as Matlab(tm) and GNU Octave. Inexpensive 8 GB cards have been used for testing. Logging is started automatically when a card is detected in the PolyDAQ and stopped when the card is removed. Data is written to files which are automatically named in sequence: <code>DATA_000.CSV</code>, <code>DATA_001.CSV</code>, <code>DATA_002.CSV</code>, and so on. It is not recommended to delete a file during a project because the PolyDAQ will re-use its file name, and there is no useful time and date information stored with a file, so it can become difficult to determine which data was taken into which file when.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="pds_sd_led"></a>
The Orange LED</h2>
<p>When not logging data, the PolyDAQ's orange SD indicator LED pulses smoothly on and off as a "heartbeat" indicator to show that the software is working properly. When data is being logged, the heartbeat signal is turned off, and the user should see a series of brief flashes from the orange LED. Each flash indicates data being written to the SD card. Data which is taken after a flash from the LED is not saved to the card until the next flash, and if the card is removed from its socket before the light flashes, that data will be lost. Therefore, the user should wait until seeing the SD indicator LED flash at least once <em>after</em> having taken important data to remove the card or cut power to the PolyDAQ.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="pds_sd_rate"></a>
Data Rates</h2>
<p>The rate at which data can be logged is limited by the speed at which it can be reliably written to the SD card. The larger the number of channels whose data is being logged, the more slowly each channel must be taken. If only one channel of data (plus time stamps) is being recorded, around 500 points per second can be saved. If four channels are being stored, the maximum rate is about 200 channels per second. These rates allow data to be taken continuously for hours, and the data files can grow to many megabytes in size. For large files, using scripts in a mathematical programming language such as Matlab(tm) or Octave is usually much more efficient than using a spreadsheet program for analysis. For small files, spreadsheets are very convenient.</p>
<p>If one attempts to take data faster than the PolyDAQ can handle it, the results are not necessarily completely disastrous because the time at which each set of data is taken is written in the data file. This allows garbage data to be removed and whatever good data is available to be used. However, keeping safely within the speed limits of the PolyDAQ makes data analysis and filtering <em>much</em> easier.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="pds_sd_config"></a>
The Configuration File</h2>
<p>In order for data logging to work, there must be a file on the SD card called <code>polydaq2.cfg</code> containing information about which data is to be collected and how often. This file must contain at least the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A time per data row line. This line begins with an uppercase <code>T</code> followed by a colon, space, and number of milliseconds per data line. To take data once every 20 milliseconds: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">T: 20</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>One or more channel configuration lines. Each of these lines begins with an uppercase <code>C</code>, then has a channel command (see the <a class="el" href="pd_channels.html">Channel Commands</a> page) and numbers specifying calibration slope and offset. Last comes the channel's name in quotes. To measure strain from the <code>S1</code> channel (whose channel command is "9"), writing the A/D output without changing its scale or offset, one would put the following line into <code>polydaq2.cfg:</code> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">C: 9, 1.0, 0.0, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Strain 1&quot;</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> An example configuration file follows. In this file, the angle potentiometer and accelerometer data are saved as calibrated data in physical units, while the strain data is saved as raw A/D bits, not changed into physical units before saving on the SD card: <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"># PolyDAQ2 Logger Configuration File</span></div>
