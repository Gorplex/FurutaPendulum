End-\/of-\/line character or characters used in data log files. 

This macro defines the character or characters which will be written to the end of each line of data which is being saved to the S\-D card. The file is typically written in C\-S\-V format so it can be easily read by spreadsheet and mathematical analysis programs. Different operating systems use different standards for end-\/of-\/line characters; for example, M\-S-\/\-D\-O\-S(tm) and Windows(tm) use {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n\char`\"{}}, while Unix(tm), Linux(tm), and Mac\-O\-S\-X(tm) use {\ttfamily '\textbackslash{}n'}. Many spreadsheet programs seem to work best with the single carriage return character {\ttfamily '\textbackslash{}n'}.
