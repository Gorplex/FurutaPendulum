Source code for a base class for small program configuration files.  


{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}config\-\_\-file.\-h\char`\"{}}\\*


\subsection{Detailed Description}
Source code for a base class for small program configuration files. This file contains the source for a base class used to create a parser for really simple configuration files which are to be kept on an S\-D cards or similar devices. The S\-D card (or other device) is expected to be used in a small microcontroller based data logger or similar device. This base class provides generic configuration file reading functions; it is expected that descendents will be designed to read specific files in specific projects.
