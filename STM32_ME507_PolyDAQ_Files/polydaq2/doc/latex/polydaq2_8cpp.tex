Number of iterations to make when attempting to balance the bridge. 

This number specifies how many iterations will be made by the bridge balancer. The automatic balancing process is a sort of successive approximation beginning at half the full-\/scale value, but due to noise things can get wonky near the end of the approximation process, so we like to give lots of chances to hit the right value.

Tolerance within which strain gauge balancing is considered acceptable. 

When a strain gauge bridge is balanced by using the D/\-A, it is often not possible to get the zero-\/strain amplified bridge output to be exactly the desired value. This tolerance defines a range within which the balancing is considered good enough; the amplified output can be higher or lower than the desired value by this amount and the balance will be considered good enough.
