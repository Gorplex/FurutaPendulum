/** @brief   Write a signed 64-bit number to a serial device.
 *  @details This operator writes a signed long integer (@c int64_t) to the serial 
 *           device as a stream of characters. Descendent classes of @c emstream will
 *           provide methods @c putchar() and @c puts() to allow the characters to be
 *           physically printed or sent. The code for this function was written by 
 *           Luk√°s Chmela and Released under GPLv3; it was found at 
 *           http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~slowe/cpp/itoa.html and modified for use with 
 *           class \c emstream. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device to which the data was printed. This
 *           reference is used to string printable items together with "<<" operators
 *  @param   num The 64-bit number to be sent out
