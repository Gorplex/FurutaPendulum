/** @brief   Write an unsigned 32-bit number to a serial device. 
 *  @details This operator writes unsigned 32-bit integers to a serial device as a 
 *           stream of characters. Descendent classes of @c emstream will provide 
 *           methods @c putchar() and @c puts() to allow the characters to be
 *           physically printed or sent. The code for this function was written by 
 *           Luk√°s Chmela and Released under GPLv3; it was found at 
 *           http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~slowe/cpp/itoa.html and modified for use with 
 *           class \c emstream. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device to which the data was printed. This
 *           reference is used to string printable items together with "<<" operators
 *  @param   num The 32-bit number to be sent out

/** @brief   Read a 32-bit unsigned decimal integer from a serial device.
 *  @details This low-budget imitation of an @c istream reads an unsigned integer. The
 *           integer must be in decimal form. If the integer is too large to fit in a
 *           32-bit number, there will be silent overflow and problems; this operator
 *           is designed to work in a small microcontroller which doesn't have room for
 *           fancy stuff such as exception handling. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device from which the data was read. This
 *           reference is used to string many read commands together if needed
 *  @param   number The 32-bit number to be filled with the data that has been read
