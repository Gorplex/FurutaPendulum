/** @brief   Write a signed 16-bit number to a serial device. 
 *  @details This operator writes a signed short integer (@c int16_t) to the serial 
 *           device as a stream of characters. Descendent classes of @c emstream will
 *           provide methods @c putchar() and @c puts() to allow the characters to be
 *           physically printed or sent. The code for this function was written by 
 *           Luk√°s Chmela and Released under GPLv3; it was found at 
 *           http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~slowe/cpp/itoa.html and modified for use with 
 *           class \c emstream. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device to which the data was printed. This
 *           reference is used to string printable items together with "<<" operators
 *  @param   num The 16-bit number to be sent out

/** @brief   Read a 16-bit signed decimal integer from a serial device.
 *  @details This low-budget imitation of @c istream reads a signed integer. The
 *           integer must be in decimal form. If the integer is too large to fit in an
 *           16-bit number, there will be silent overflow and problems; this operator
 *           is designed to work in a small microcontroller which doesn't have room for
 *           fancy stuff such as exception handling. 
 *           @li @b FEATURE: If a negative sign is found @e anywhere before the 
 *               beginning of the number (not just immediately to the left of the first
 *               numeric digit), the number is considered negative. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device from which the data was read. This
 *           reference is used to string many read commands together if needed
 *  @param   number The 16-bit number to be filled with the data that has been read
