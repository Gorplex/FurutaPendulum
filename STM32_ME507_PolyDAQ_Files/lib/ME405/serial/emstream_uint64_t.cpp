/** @brief   Write an unsigned 64-bit number to a serial device. 
 *  @details This operator writes unsigned 64-bit integers to a serial device as a 
 *           stream of characters. Descendent classes of @c emstream will provide 
 *           methods @c putchar() and @c puts() to allow the characters to be 
 *           physically printed or sent. The code for this function was written by 
 *           Luk√°s Chmela and Released under GPLv3; it was found at 
 *           http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~slowe/cpp/itoa.html and modified for use with 
 *           class \c emstream. 
 *  @return  A reference to the serial device to which the data was printed. This
 *           reference is used to string printable items together with "<<" operators
 *  @param   num The 64-bit number to be sent out
