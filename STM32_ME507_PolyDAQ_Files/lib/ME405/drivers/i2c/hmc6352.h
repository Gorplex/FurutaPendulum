/** This class is a driver for a Honeywell HMC6352 compass. It's very basic and does
 *  not use all the HMC6352's functions; it is set up only to put the compass in 
 *  standby mode and take a heading measurement when asked for, or optionally to put
 *  the compass into continuous measurement mode (in which the compass measures its
 *  heading once every second) and then read out the previous heading measurement
 *  quickly on demand. 
 * 
 *  \section use_hmc6352 Usage
 *  To use this driver, one need only create the driver object and then ask it for a
 *  heading now and then.
 *  \code
 *  hmc6352* p_honey = new hmc6352 (p_serial);
 *  ...
 *  *p_serial << PMS ("HMC6352: ") << p_honey->get_heading () << endl;
 *  \endcode
