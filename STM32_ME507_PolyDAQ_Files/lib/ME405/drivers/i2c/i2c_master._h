/** @file i2c_master.h
 *    This file contains a base class for classes that use the I2C (also known as TWI)
 *    interface on an AVR. The terms "I2C" (the two means squared) and "TWI" are
 *    essentially equivalent; Philips has trademarked the former, and Atmel doesn't pay
 *    them a license fee, so Atmel chips that meet exactly the same specification are
 *    not allowed to use the "I2C" name, even though everything works the same. 
 *
 *    Note: The terms "master" and "slave" are standard terminology used in the
 *    electronics industry to describe interactions between electronic components only.
 *    The use of such terms in this documentation is made only for the purpose of 
 *    usefully documenting electronic hardware and software, and such use must not be
 *    misconstrued as diminishing our revulsion at the socially diseased human behavior 
 *    which is described using the same terms, nor implying any insensitivity toward
 *    people from any background who have been affected by such behavior. 
 *
 *  Revised:
 *    @li 12-24-2012 JRR Original file, as a standalone HMC6352 compass driver
 *    @li 12-28-2012 JRR I2C driver split off into a base class for optimal reusability
 *    @li 02-12-2015 JRR Version made for STM32F4 processors

/** @brief   A simple driver for an I2C (also known as TWI) bus. 
 *  @details It encapsulates basic I2C functionality such as the ability to send and
 *           receive bytes through the I2C bus. Currently only operation of the 
 *           microcontroller as an I2C bus master is supported; this is what's needed 
 *           for the microcontroller to interface with most I2C based sensors. 
 * 
 *           @section STM32 Pins
 *           For the STM32, each of the I2C ports can be configured to use various sets
 *           of pins. For simplicity, this driver is coded to use the following pins:
 * 
 *           Port |  SCL  |  SDA
 *           :---:|:-----:|:-----:
 *           I2C1 |  PB6  |  PB7
 *           I2C2 |  PB10 |  PB11
 *           I2C3 |  PA8  |  PA9
 * 
 *           Due to the design of the STM32 standard peripheral library, these pin
 *           assignments are most easily changed by editing the source code.
